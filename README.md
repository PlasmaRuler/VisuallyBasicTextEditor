# VisuallyBasicTextEditor
A basic text editor coded in C. Also generates some 6 digit numbers if you want those.

I left an executable file if you don't want to compile it. However if you do you can go to the source code's folder in the command line.
and compile it with any C compiler while linking with the comdlg32 (and v1.2 with the GDI32) library I use MinGW GCC as my compilier so the command would be: gcc main.c -lcomdlg32 (edit for v1.2 -lgdi32)

Please leave feedback and improvements you made or would like me to make. 
You are free to distribute and modify it as you wish, and I am not liably for the effects of any changes you make (If for some reason someone changes the source code to something malicous)
